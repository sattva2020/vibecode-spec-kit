# Memory Bank System v0.7-beta

## A Message from the Creator

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

When I built cursor-memory-bank, it was my personal project to solve a problem I faced daily as a software engineer. With extensive experience in the field, I knew there had to be a better way to harness AI for actual development work.

Your **2,400+ stars** and incredible feedback proved this vision resonated - but also showed me what I was really after wasn't just setup tools. **I wanted working prototypes.**

So I went back to my software engineering roots and built something that delivers on the original promise: **Three-Tier Orchestration Architecture** that uses advanced prompt engineering and specialized agents to handle all the heavy lifting - from natural language request to browser-tested application.

**What cursor-memory-bank started as my personal solution, this completes:**
- Say "implement this PRD.md" â†’ Get complete project breakdown with TaskMaster coordination
- Say "build a user management system with RBAC" â†’ Get 5-tier role hierarchy with 28 permissions
- Say "create an e-commerce platform" â†’ Get product catalog, cart, checkout, and payment integration
- Say "add real-time collaboration features" â†’ Get WebSocket implementation with conflict resolution

Drawing on my engineering experience, the new system addresses major limitations while keeping the same core vision: **AI that actually builds working software.** As we discover new challenges, we add specialized agents to keep evolving the system.

cursor-memory-bank will stay here as the foundation that made this possible. But if you want to see where my engineering journey leads, check out the evolution:

> **Personal Note**: Memory Bank is my personal hobby project that I develop for my own use in coding projects. As this is a personal project, I don't maintain an issues tracker or actively collect feedback. However, if you're using these rules and encounter issues, one of the great advantages is that you can ask the Cursor AI directly to modify or update the rules to better suit your specific workflow. The system is designed to be adaptable by the AI, allowing you to customize it for your own needs without requiring external support.

## About Memory Bank

Memory Bank is a personal project that provides a structured approach to development using specialized modes for different phases of the development process. It uses a hierarchical rule loading architecture that loads only the rules needed for each phase, optimizing token usage and providing tailored guidance.

### Token-Optimized Architecture

Version 0.7-beta introduces significant token optimization improvements:

- **Hierarchical Rule Loading**: Only loads essential rules initially with specialized lazy-loading
- **Progressive Documentation**: Implements concise templates that scale with task complexity
- **Optimized Mode Transitions**: Preserves critical context efficiently between modes
- **Level-Specific Workflows**: Adapts documentation requirements to task complexity

See the [Memory Bank Optimizations](MEMORY_BANK_OPTIMIZATIONS.md) document for detailed information about all optimization approaches.

### Beyond Basic Custom Modes

While Cursor's documentation describes custom modes as primarily standalone configurations with basic prompts and tool selections, Memory Bank significantly extends this concept:

- **Graph-Based Mode Integration**: Modes are interconnected nodes in a development workflow rather than isolated tools
- **Workflow Progression**: Modes are designed to transition from one to another in a logical sequence (VAN â†’ PLAN â†’ CREATIVE â†’ IMPLEMENT â†’ REFLECT â†’ ARCHIVE)
- **Shared Memory**: Persistent state maintained across mode transitions via Memory Bank files
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Each mode adjusts its recommendations based on project complexity
- **Built-in QA Functions**: QA capabilities can be called from any mode for technical validation

This approach transforms custom modes from simple AI personalities into components of a coordinated development system with specialized phases working together.

### CREATIVE Mode and Claude's "Think" Tool

The CREATIVE mode in Memory Bank is conceptually based on Anthropic's Claude "Think" tool methodology, as described in their [engineering blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool). The v0.7-beta implements an optimized version with:

- Progressive documentation with tabular option comparison
- "Detail-on-demand" approach that preserves token efficiency
- Structured templates that scale with complexity level
- Efficient context preservation for implementation phases

For a detailed explanation of how Memory Bank implements these principles, see the [CREATIVE Mode and Claude's "Think" Tool](creative_mode_think_tool.md) document.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Rule Loading**: Load only the essential rules with specialized lazy-loading
- **Progressive Documentation**: Concise templates that scale with task complexity
- **Unified Context Transfer**: Efficient context preservation between modes
- **Mode-Specific Visual Maps**: Clear visual representations for each development phase
- **Level-Specific Workflows**: Adapted processes based on complexity (Levels 1-4)
- **Platform-Aware Commands**: Automatically adapts commands to your operating system

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Cursor Editor**: Version 0.48 or higher is required.
- **Custom Modes**: Feature must be enabled in Cursor (Settings â†’ Features â†’ Chat â†’ Custom modes).
<img src="assets/open_custom_modes.png" alt="Opening Custom Modes Menu"/>

- **AI Model**: Claude 4 Sonnet or Claude 4 Opus is recommended for best results, especially for CREATIVE mode's "Think" tool methodology.

### Step 0: Bootstrap the Memory Bank files

Before activating any custom modes, create the working Memory Bank documents for your project. Run the bootstrap script from the repository root and point it to the directory where you want the files to live (for example, your project's `.cursor/memory_bank/` folder):

```
python tools/bootstrap_memory_bank.py --dest /path/to/your/project/memory_bank
```

The script creates four files if they do not exist:

- `tasks.md`
- `progress.md`
- `activeContext.md`
- `projectbrief.md`

To confirm they are ready before switching modes, list the directory or open the files directly:

```
ls /path/to/your/project/memory_bank
```

If you need to regenerate the templates, rerun the command with `--force` to overwrite existing files.

### Step 1: Get the Files

Simply clone this repository into your project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/vanzan01/cursor-memory-bank.git
```

#### Alternative (Manual)

After extracting it from the ZIP file, follow the steps below.

- Copy the `.cursor` and `custom_modes` folders to the project directory

Note: other documents are not necessary for memory bank operation, they are explanatory documents. You can copy them to a folder like `memory_bank_documents`.

### Step 1.5: Initialize Memory Bank Templates

The repository now includes reusable templates in [`templates/`](templates/) that match the required structures defined in `.cursor/rules`. Copy them into your working project's `memory-bank/` directory before you begin planning:

```bash
mkdir -p memory-bank/creative memory-bank/reflection
cp templates/tasks.md memory-bank/tasks.md
cp templates/activeContext.md memory-bank/activeContext.md
cp templates/progress.md memory-bank/progress.md
cp templates/creative-template.md memory-bank/creative/creative-template.md
cp templates/reflect-template.md memory-bank/reflection/reflect-template.md
```

Each template provides the baseline sections that the rules expect:

- **`tasks.md`** â€“ Contains the planning scaffold with description, complexity, technology stack, validation checklist, status tracker, implementation plan, creative phase flags, dependencies, and mitigation notes drawn from the PLAN mode requirements.
- **`activeContext.md`** â€“ Keeps the current focus synchronized with `tasks.md` and includes status snapshots, recent changes, next steps, blockers, and transition checklist items that align with VAN/PLAN mode verification.
- **`progress.md`** â€“ Captures implementation progress with absolute paths, key changes, testing evidence, and verification checklist items mandated by IMPLEMENT mode.
- **`creative-template.md`** â€“ Implements the optimized creative phase structure (problem, options, analysis table, decision, implementation notes, and verification checks) for documenting design decisions.
- **`reflect-template.md`** â€“ Provides the reflection framework (summary, what went well, challenges, lessons, improvements, next steps, and completion checklist) required before transitioning to ARCHIVE mode.

### Step 2: Setting Up Custom Modes in Cursor

**Skip the manual copy/paste.** Generate an importable configuration and let Cursor create every mode for you.


1. From the repository root, run:
   ```bash
   python tools/generate_cursor_modes.py --output cursor_modes/cursor_modes.json
   ```
   This command collects every Markdown instruction from `custom_modes/` and packages the correct emojis, names, tool selections, and source paths into a Cursor-compatible bundle.
2. In Cursor, open **Settings â†’ Chat â†’ Custom modes** and click **Import custom modes**.
3. Select the newly generated `cursor_modes/cursor_modes.json` (or a ZIP produced by the same script) and confirm the import. Cursor will add the VAN, PLAN, CREATIVE, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT/ARCHIVE modes automatically.


> REFLECT and ARCHIVE instructions remain combined in a single mode to respect Cursor's limitsâ€”an optimization originally contributed by GitHub user @joshmac007.
> The repository includes a generated example at `cursor_modes/cursor_modes.json`, but you should re-run the command above whenever the instruction files change so the bundle stays up to date.

For additional help on importing custom modes in Cursor, refer to the [official Cursor documentation on custom modes](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/custom-modes).

### QA Functionality

QA is not a separate custom mode but rather a set of validation functions that can be called from any mode. You can invoke QA capabilities by typing "QA" in any mode when you need to perform technical validation. This approach provides flexibility to conduct verification at any point in the development process.

## Basic Usage

1. **Start with VAN Mode**:
   - Switch to VAN mode in Cursor
   - Type "VAN" to initiate the initialization process
   - VAN will analyze your project structure and determine complexity

2. **Follow the Workflow Based on Complexity**:
   - **Level 1 tasks**: May proceed directly to IMPLEMENT after VAN
   - **Level 2 tasks**: Simplified workflow (VAN â†’ PLAN â†’ IMPLEMENT â†’ REFLECT)
   - **Level 3-4 tasks**: Full workflow (VAN â†’ PLAN â†’ CREATIVE â†’ IMPLEMENT â†’ REFLECT â†’ ARCHIVE)
   - **At any point**: Type "QA" to perform technical validation

3. **Mode-Specific Commands**:
   ```
   VAN - Initialize project and determine complexity
   PLAN - Create detailed implementation plan
   CREATIVE - Explore design options for complex components
   IMPLEMENT - Systematically build planned components
   REFLECT - Review and document lessons learned
   ARCHIVE - Create comprehensive documentation
   QA - Validate technical implementation (can be called from any mode)
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Mode not responding correctly**:
   - Verify custom instructions were copied completely (this is the most common issue)
   - Ensure the correct tools are enabled for each mode
   - Check that you've switched to the correct mode before issuing commands
   - Make sure you pasted the instructions in the "Advanced options" text box

2. **Rules not loading**:
   - Make sure the `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/` directory is in the correct location
   - Verify file permissions allow reading the rule files

3. **Command execution issues**:
   - Ensure you're running commands from the correct directory
   - Verify platform-specific commands are being used correctly
