# Memory Bank Constitution

**Project**: VS Code Memory Bank System  
**Version**: 2.0 (Integrated with Spec Kit Methodologies)  
**Last Updated**: 04.10.2025

## Nine Articles of Development

### Article I: Memory-First Principle
Every feature must be designed with context preservation as the primary concern. The Memory Bank system shall serve as the single source of truth for project context, task state, and decision history.

**Constitutional Gates:**
- All modes must update Memory Bank files
- No implementation without active context documentation
- Context must be preserved across sessions

### Article II: Spec-Driven Development
All Level 2+ features shall follow Spec-Driven Development principles, with executable specifications serving as the foundation for implementation.

**Constitutional Gates:**
- Specifications must be created before planning
- Specifications must include user scenarios and acceptance criteria
- All specifications must be validated before implementation

### Article III: Test-First Imperative
For Level 2+ tasks, Test-Driven Development is mandatory. Tests shall be written before implementation, and all features must pass comprehensive test suites.

**Constitutional Gates:**
- Unit tests required for all new code
- Integration tests required for system interactions
- Contract tests required for API boundaries
- QA validation must pass before BUILD mode

### Article IV: Constitutional Gates
Every mode transition shall include constitutional validation to ensure adherence to these principles.

**Constitutional Gates:**
- VAN mode: Validate Memory Bank structure
- PLAN mode: Validate specification completeness
- CREATIVE mode: Validate design decisions against constitution
- IMPLEMENT mode: Validate test coverage and specifications
- REFLECT mode: Validate learning capture and documentation

### Article V: Multi-AI Agent Support
The system shall support multiple AI agents while maintaining consistency and interoperability.

**Constitutional Gates:**
- All AI agents must use same Memory Bank structure
- Agent-specific adapters must preserve core functionality
- Cross-agent compatibility must be maintained

### Article VI: Token Optimization
The system shall maintain token efficiency while providing comprehensive functionality.

**Constitutional Gates:**
- Hierarchical rule loading must be maintained
- Token usage must be tracked and optimized
- Context compression must preserve essential information

### Article VII: Documentation Integrity
All documentation shall be automatically synchronized and maintained as living documents.

**Constitutional Gates:**
- SYNC mode must update all documentation
- README, CHANGELOG, and ADR must be current
- Documentation must reflect actual implementation

### Article VIII: Workflow Consistency
The 8-mode workflow (VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT → REFLECT → ARCHIVE → SYNC → QA) shall be maintained and enhanced.

**Constitutional Gates:**
- Mode transitions must follow defined protocols
- Each mode must have clear entry and exit criteria
- Workflow integrity must be preserved across integrations

### Article IX: Backward Compatibility
All enhancements shall maintain backward compatibility with existing Memory Bank functionality.

**Constitutional Gates:**
- Existing workflows must continue to function
- New features must be optional or configurable
- Migration paths must be provided for existing users

## Constitutional Validation Process

### Validation Checkpoints
1. **Memory Bank Integrity**: All required files present and valid
2. **Specification Completeness**: All specifications include required elements
3. **Test Coverage**: Required tests are present and passing
4. **Documentation Currency**: All documentation is up-to-date
5. **Workflow Compliance**: Mode transitions follow constitutional rules

### Validation Failure Handling
- **Minor Violations**: Warnings with suggestions for correction
- **Major Violations**: Block mode transition until resolved
- **Critical Violations**: Halt implementation and require constitutional review

## Constitutional Amendments

Amendments to this constitution require:
1. Consensus among core contributors
2. Impact assessment on existing workflows
3. Migration plan for existing implementations
4. Documentation updates across all affected systems

---

**Constitutional Authority**: This constitution governs all development activities within the Memory Bank ecosystem and takes precedence over individual mode rules when conflicts arise.
